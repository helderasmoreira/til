# Always be learning

Did your interview/challenge/test not go as planned?

Give yourself maybe a couple of hours to feel disappointed. Maybe you didn't prepare well enough or maybe you were just outsmarted.

Now, brush that aside and think: what did you learn from this? What can you learn from this moving forward?

Take ownership of each opportunity and treat it as a learning one.
