# Breakpoints are not as useful in emails

When using CSS breakpoints in emails keep in mind that when vieweing your email in a web client the size available to your email will not be the size of the window. Often the email is just part of the page, there's sidebars and other elements that take up space.

This might (often) mean that your email has 300px of space when the window is still sized at 1000px and therefore the breakpoint has not been "activated".
